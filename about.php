          Innovative Technological College of the Philippines, Inc. or INNO-TECH was created to cater the people of Cebu with its initial operation at Minglanilla and intends to branch out in the different strategic towns and cities of the province by 2012.

          The primary goal of INNO-TECH is to provide an alternative education for the youth who are not ‘academically prepared and financially ready’ to take up degree courses. Having in mind that these youth should be ‘globally competitive’ even without bachelor’s degree, we came up in bundling a number of TESDA Courses that will make them ‘Highly-skilled, Multi-skilled and Innovative’ individuals and combining it with our unique ‘Moral Values & Discipline’ program with emphasis on ‘Spiritual Development’ altogether result to ‘Personhood Enrichment’ that will help these youth to get gainful employment.
